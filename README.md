# Player Status
Player information in a GUI!

Plugin written by Atticus Zambrana (TheBeefSteak)

This plugin makes it easy for the author to view player information on his server.  It is released to the public.

The original version 1.0 project, developed for 1.12, and tested on 1.11, is published here:
* https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/player-status.44041/
* https://github.com/atticusthecoder/player-status
    
A fork of the project (1.1.0) eliminates errors observed when running on 1.14.4:
* https://github.com/kbulgrien/player-status
  * This modification is the result of an experiment on learning how to resolve build errors related to API updates.
  * Changes do not include assurance of backward compatibility with servers older than 1.13.
  * This author used JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to make the new .jar file.
  * The pre-built .jar file targets Java 1.8.
